# Python Dockerized

This is a basic project template for creating a Docker container for Python 3 applications.

## Usage

To build the Docker image, navigate to the `docker` directory and execute the build script. This script will automatically install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file and proceed to install the entire Python module.
Once the image is built, you can run the container using the provided run command.
Feel free to customize the project according to your specific needs and requirements.
